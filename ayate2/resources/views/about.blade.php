                The name Ayate-a metaphor stemming from the tender and congenial care grandparents give their grandchildren-was chosen
                for the similarity of service and website functionality to be provided by the system. The idea of the project might be
                new in Ethiopia since no similar system has been built either in website or mobile application format. However, similar
                ideas can be seen in iOS and Android application stores. In fact, we drove our initiatives about user interactions from
                some of those systems that have been a success worldwide.
The android application Natural Cure + is one that is recommended by licensed doctors in the United States of America. It provides full
functionalities from searching for a remedy from a predefined encyclopedia of illness up to remedy submissions by users. Doctors and nutritionists
contributed a lot to the development of the application from the perspective of their knowledge. That undoubtedly must have reserved for its android
application status today.
Another successful mobile application is the Natural Care pro available in the App Store. This app received large-scale positive feedbacks from the
 application's users for myriads of reasons. One big feature the software possess is the availability of the data and content in six different languages.
We thoroughly considered the above-mentioned systems and others more in creating the optimal vision for Ayate. The important feature that makes Ayate
different from these apps is that it is a site of Ethiopian home remedies.
What we, as a team, have been trying to address is the question of uncertainty these users would have on listed remedies and most that wish they could
know of their relevancies. Ayate is not a mere remedy listing system rather a system that rebuilds usersâ€™
confidence on remedies through an association of expert that either approve or debunk it. Aiming to reach the goal we set ahead
of us, we resolved on making a system that also possesses features most common to mobile application like searching for certain results. It can, therefore,
be said that user involvement is the key aspect in Ayate. As to the comparison of our idea with the locally claimed ones, in the span of time we are building this project, no system similar in idea and form has been built yet.
